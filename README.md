# verj-mcp-client-prototype
This is just a prototype/POC project. This probably will never become production-ready.

It may be useful to someone as a starting point to create MCP clients. 

I'm certainly using it to learn more about ai agents in general.

This is a client application.

The idea is that this will become integrated into Verj.io Studio as a coding assistant, 
able to provide more context to questions as well as an interface (via MCP services) to create various verj.io entites in a workspace.
